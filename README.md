# MsgRoom Client API

This is the source code for the MsgRoom client API. The client API can be used to connect to the MsgRoom service as a bot or user.

## Important Notes

API general terms:
  
  - API abuse will not be tolerated.
  - You will obey all rate limits accordingly.
  - Custom clients designed to disrupt the general experience will also be grounds for a ban.

Bot specific rules:
  
  - Your bot must login as a bot account. If your bot is caught using a user account to facilitate bot services, you and your bot will be immediately banned.

  - Bots must have a unique prefix. The server may reject entry if a prefix is already taken. Therefore, consider choosing something unique.
